After downloading the project from GitHub, open your terminal and run composer install to install the PHP dependencies.
Then, copy the .env.example file to .env and configure your environment variables (like database settings).
Next, run php artisan key:generate to generate the application key.
After that, run php artisan migrate to create the database tables.
Finally, start the Laravel development server by running php artisan serve.
The application will be available locally at http://localhost:8000.
